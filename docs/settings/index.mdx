architus bot settings are dynamically rendered, consumed, and validated based off of a JSON schema as detailed below.

## Top-level format

At the highest level, the Settings schema is composed of an array of category definitions, each of which contain one or more settings cards:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

The reasoning behind having a top-level organization scheme of the `category` is to support a view that looks something like the following mockup, where multiple vertical sections would be possible, enabling large collections of settings
to be effectively categorized.
